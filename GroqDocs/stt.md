Transcribes audio into the input language.

Request Body
model
string
Required
ID of the model to use. whisper-large-v3 and whisper-large-v3-turbo are currently available.

file
string
Optional
The audio file object (not file name) to transcribe, in one of these formats: flac, mp3, mp4, mpeg, mpga, m4a, ogg, wav, or webm. Either a file or a URL must be provided. Note that the file field is not supported in Batch API requests.

language
string
Optional
The language of the input audio. Supplying the input language in ISO-639-1 format will improve accuracy and latency.

prompt
string
Optional
An optional text to guide the model's style or continue a previous audio segment. The prompt should match the audio language.

response_format
string
Optional
Defaults to json
Allowed values: json, text, verbose_json
The format of the transcript output, in one of these options: json, text, or verbose_json.

temperature
number
Optional
Defaults to 0
The sampling temperature, between 0 and 1. Higher values like 0.8 will make the output more random, while lower values like 0.2 will make it more focused and deterministic. If set to 0, the model will use log probability to automatically increase the temperature until certain thresholds are hit.

timestamp_granularities[]
array
Optional
Defaults to segment
The timestamp granularities to populate for this transcription. response_format must be set verbose_json to use timestamp granularities. Either or both of these options are supported: word, or segment. Note: There is no additional latency for segment timestamps, but generating word timestamps incurs additional latency.

url
string
Optional
The audio URL to translate/transcribe (supports Base64URL). Either a file or a URL must be provided. For Batch API requests, the URL field is required since the file field is not supported.

Returns
Returns an audio transcription object.
